# social_book_final
This is a practice project in which I tried to implement some features in a python and django website which includes -
-> Email message after the user login to the website. 
-> Using postgres sql database which was hosted on aws.
-> Implementing aws s3 buckets to store static and media files
-> Creating an api to generate authentication token
-> Using that token to grant access to open certain files.
